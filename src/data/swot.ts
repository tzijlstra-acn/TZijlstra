  strengths: [
    { title: "Open-weight sovereignty", body: "K2.6, K2.7, K3 under Modified MIT. EU enterprises self-host on EU infrastructure — zero GDPR/Schrems II transfer risk." },
    { title: "1M-token context window", body: "8× GPT-5.6, 4× Claude. Genuine differentiator for legal documents, codebases, and clinical literature — no competitor matches this in open weights." },
    { title: "Cost-per-task efficiency", body: "Favourable cost-per-task on multi-step workloads based on candidate modelling. Exact task-unit economics vary by workload and must be validated against customer requirements." },
    { title: "AWS Marketplace + EU infrastructure", body: "Immediate enterprise credibility. Procurement via existing AWS contracts — no new vendor onboarding required." },
    { title: "Agentic capabilities", body: "Native 300-sub-agent swarm (K2.6+), Kimi Work desktop agent. Ahead of most open-weight providers on agentic AI." },
    { title: "Capital position", body: "Reported strong capitalisation and valuation (figures from public reporting, unverified by candidate). Signals long-term stability to risk-averse European procurement teams." },
    { title: "Proven Western traction", body: "Cursor, DoorDash, Coinbase, Airbnb, Thinking Machines Lab. Not 'cheap alternative' — 'better quality, lower cost.'" },
  ] as SwotItem[],
  weaknesses: [
    { title: "Geopolitical origin", body: "Chinese-origin AI faces regulatory scrutiny in Western markets. US regulatory environment has been challenging; EU procurement teams typically run additional legal and security review. Specific regulatory actions evolve — verify current status before citing." },
    { title: "Compliance certification gap", body: "No published SOC 2, HITRUST, HIPAA BAA, or ISO 27001 for hosted API. Enterprise tier claims privacy but lacks independent attestation." },
    { title: "Hosted API data residency", body: "API operated by Moonshot AI PTE. LTD. (Singapore), data stored in Singapore. GDPR-blocking for EU-covered data without self-hosting." },
    { title: "Ecosystem immaturity", body: "Fewer tutorials, integrations, community resources than OpenAI/Anthropic. EU developer teams hit thinner support when edge-casing." },
    { title: "Language limitation", body: "Optimised for Chinese and English. French, German, Spanish, Italian output is less consistent than Mistral, which natively targets these markets." },
    { title: "Verbose reasoning = hidden cost", body: "K3 generates ~2× median output tokens of comparable reasoning models. At $15/M output, this erodes the headline price advantage on complex agent tasks." },
    { title: "Limited EU enterprise track record", body: "Not included in Gartner 2026 Enterprise AI Coding Agents evaluation. Short Western enterprise reference base outside tech startups." },
  ] as SwotItem[],
  opportunities: [
    { title: "Sovereign AI megatrend", body: "Strong enterprise demand signal for AI sovereignty driven by EU AI Act and Schrems II compliance requirements. Market research figures circulate widely in this space; candidate has not independently verified specific survey statistics." },
    { title: "European AI adoption gap", body: "EU enterprise AI adoption at 13.48% (2024). The gap is not lack of interest — it is data governance. Self-hosted open-weight models close this." },
    { title: "SI channel opportunity", body: "European SIs (Accenture, Capgemini, Deloitte) need competitive, sovereign AI models to build practices around. Open weights mean no vendor lock-in for them." },
    { title: "EU AI Act compliance window", body: "Phased enforcement beginning August 2026. Enterprises need audit trails, transparency, data control. Self-hosted Kimi + local logging = compliant architecture." },
    { title: "Price arbitrage vs. US incumbents", body: "K3 at $15/M output vs. comparable premium frontier alternatives. European enterprises under margin pressure — compelling CFO conversation. Pricing from public API pages as of August 2026." },
    { title: "AWS Marketplace acceleration", body: "European AWS customers discover and procure through existing cloud contracts, bypassing lengthy vendor onboarding processes." },
    { title: "Open-source ecosystem lock-in", body: "If Kimi becomes the default open-weight model for EU developers (via Ollama, vLLM, Hugging Face), creates stickiness that transcends geopolitical concerns." },
  ] as SwotItem[],
  threats: [
    { title: "Mistral: the 'safe' EU alternative", body: "French/German government framework agreements (2026–2030), HSBC, Stellantis, Veolia, Apache 2.0. For risk-averse CISOs, Mistral is the default sovereign choice." },
    { title: "EU AI Act systemic risk classification", body: "If K3 training run crosses 10^25 FLOP threshold, triggers additional compliance burdens — red-teaming, incident reporting — slowing enterprise adoption." },
    { title: "Geopolitical escalation", body: "If EU governments follow the US lead and restrict Chinese AI models on sensitive infrastructure, Moonshot faces de facto bans in public sector and critical infrastructure." },
    { title: "DeepSeek on price", body: "DeepSeek pricing is the budget benchmark in public AI pricing. For pure cost plays, Moonshot is vulnerable at the low end. DeepSeek pricing from public channels as of August 2026." },
    { title: "Open-weight monetisation challenge", body: "Enterprises self-hosting K3 pay $0 API fees. Must capture value through support, fine-tuning, or the $20M+ revenue-sharing clause — enforcement is untested." },
    { title: "Safety and reputation risk", body: "Open weights can be misused. One high-profile incident (deepfakes, cyberattack tooling) triggers regulatory backlash against all Chinese open-weight models." },
    { title: "US CLOUD Act perception", body: "Even when self-hosted, some European buyers conflate 'Chinese model' with 'foreign surveillance risk.' Mistral benefits from EU-native, no CLOUD Act exposure." },
